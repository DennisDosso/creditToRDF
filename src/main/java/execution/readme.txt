Since I compile with Maven and I execute these classes from terminal, 
I do not like to have to tape each time the whole path of a class in the jar. 
This package contains the ultimate classes that are to be executed in sequence to realize the 
program. So, usually, a command becomes:

java -cp name_jar.jar execution.name_class

Smart, right? I am so lazy sometimes...
