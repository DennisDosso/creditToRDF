 * jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/KS?user=postgres&password=your_password
 * 
 * 
 * Use the method createConnectionAsOwner if you project to have multiple classes use
 * the connection and you do not let it be closed by the others.

	 * are then invoked try to get the connection via this method, which does not create new
	 * connections but only provides the one that has already been opened. The class
	 * that first opened the connection also has the right to close it later. 
	 * 
	 * @param jdbcConnectionString the string to use to connect to a PostgreSQL database
	 * @param o the name of the class. Every class should use its name to keep track of which class
	 * is the original owner of the connection and has the right to open/close the connection.
